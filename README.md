# FriendFinder
### This is the Friend Finder App: https://agile-everglades-82324.herokuapp.com/home

## The app will take in results from a user's survey answers, and then compare the answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

### The goal of this project was to demonstrate Node and Express abilities by tying both a simple front end and back end together.  There was also some logic building test associated with the "best match" feature.
